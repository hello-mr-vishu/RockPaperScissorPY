## Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is my first solo project after going through a Python tutorial. The program will allow users to play the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" against the computer in the console.

## How the Game Works

The player is prompted to enter a choice of "rock", "paper", or "scissors". The computer's choice is selected at random. The game then determines the winner based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors:

- Rock smashes scissors (Rock wins)
- Scissors cuts paper (Scissors wins)
- Paper covers rock (Paper wins)

If both the player and the computer make the same choice, the game is a tie.

## How to Run the Game

To play the game, simply run the Python script in your console. The game will guide you through the steps.
